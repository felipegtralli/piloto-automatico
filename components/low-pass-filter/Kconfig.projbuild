        help
            Enable this option to log Low Pass Filter operations for debugging purposes.
            Note that enabling logging may impact performance and increase memory usage.

    config LOW_PASS_FILTER_IGNORE_APPLY_CHECKS
        bool "Ignore arguments checks in low_pass_filter_apply()"
        default false
        help
            Enable this option to skip argument validation in the low_pass_filter_apply() function.
            This may improve performance but could lead to undefined behavior if invalid arguments are passed.
            Should only be used in critical performance scenarios where the caller guarantees argument validity.
